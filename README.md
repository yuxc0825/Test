## Code Description

The code and data in this repository correspond to the paper "**Macroscopic Modeling and Analysis Based on Microscopic Models for Swarm Systems**".  

The code and data mainly correspond to the simulation of the case study "Case study: infectious disease transmission" in section 3 of the paper. The repository consists of four folders, namely "*1_Microscopic_Model*", "*2_Macroscopic_Model_Parameter_Identification*", "*3_Macroscopic_Model_Prediction*" and "*4_Macroscopic_Model_Optimization*". The code files and data under each folder can be used directly by the users or can be modified according to their needs. The following is a detailed description of each folder's function and usage guidelines.

The "*1_Microscopic_Model*" folder contains microscopic modeling procedures for the spread of infectious diseases at N=300 and N=3000.

The "*2_Macroscopic_Model_Parameter_Identification*" folder mainly holds the macroscopic model parameter identification procedures using the gray-box system identifier method. Also included are the data used for identification and testing.
