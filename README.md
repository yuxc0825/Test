## Code Description

The code and data in this repository correspond to the paper "**Macroscopic Modeling and Analysis Based on Microscopic Models for Swarm Systems**".  

The code and data mainly correspond to the simulation of the case study "Case study: infectious disease transmission" in section 3 of the paper. The repository consists of four folders, namely "1_Microscopic_Model", "2_Macroscopic_Model_Parameter_Identification", "3_Macroscopic_Model_Prediction" and "4_Macroscopic_Model_Optimization". The code files and data under each folder can be used directly by the users or can be modified according to their needs. The following is a detailed description of each folder's function and usage guidelines.
